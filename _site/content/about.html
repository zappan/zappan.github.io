  <h2>The first talks, Supporter Packs, English only, and much much more</h2>
  <time>07.07.2014.</time>
  <p>
    We at WebCamp Zagreb are really happy to say that the interest for the conference has been excellent. We’ve received over 50 talks proposals in our first CFP round, plus we’ve cooked up some new ideas we’re announcing right now. Get ready for the first batch of speakers, plus <em>supporter packs</em> and a 2-day conference + a day of workshops!
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, you’ve read that correctly - we’re planning to do a full-blown 2-day conference, raising the bar significantly compared to the previous two years! Encouraged by the quality of the talks we’ve received through the first round of CFP, we’d really like to have all those awesome people coming to Zagreb in October.
  </p>
  <h3>Supporter Packs for a 2-day conference</h3>
  <p>
    Making that happen requires some additional support. Support from the community we’re doing this conference for, and that’s you. For this purpose, we’ve come up with a complimentary package consisting of an official WebCamp Zagreb T-shirt (a lot of you asked if you could get one last year), some cool user groups badges, stickers and other potential surprises, plus a free ticket included.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s our proposal - if we can have <strong>over 300 supporter packs</strong> sold <strong>by August 10th</strong>, when we’ll be announcing our complete speakers lineup, we’re going to do a 2-day conference (Saturday + Sunday)! If you like the deal, head to Entrio and <a href="https://www.entrio.hr/en/event/webcamp-zagreb-2014-1579" target="_blank">get your supporter pack now</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conference tickets will remain free, and while the supporter pack makes it convenient to secure your ticket by supporting the conference, we’ll reserve at least 200 free tickets that will be released early September on a first-come, first-served basis.
  </p>

  </p>
  <h3>Workshops and a Week of WebCamp</h3>
  <p>
    We’re thrilled to announce that we’ll be doing ‘more than just a conference’ - we wish to make the whole week filled with developers’ events, and we’ve taken steps in that direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can already announce that we’ll be organizing <strong>WebCamp Workshops</strong> on Friday before the conference. Some topics have been confirmed, but we’re still working on the full lineup, so we’ll keep quiet for now, except for the fact that we’re doing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we’re working with all our user groups to hold <strong>extended meetups</strong> in the week prior to the conference weekend, with a focus of getting some international speakers with more language specific topics than talks at the conference.
  </p>

  <p>
    Week of Webcamp and workshop events will be happening at the HGK (Croatian Chamber of Commerce) building, where we held our first edition of the WebCamp conference. Getting back to the roots...
  </p>
