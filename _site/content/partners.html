					<h4><a href="https://dsl-platform.com/">DSL platform</a></h4>
					<p>Most parts of business application development can be automated - DSL platform takes your business model as input and outputs finished components of your system.</p>
					<p>In the past, developers manually crafted database schemas, application servers and code libraries. As tooling improved they defined objects for servers and clients in code and tooling (i.e. ORMs) helped with create trivial mappings to the database.</p>
					<p>DSL platform takes this to the next level and will compile and maintain components from your model in all parts of the application. Advanced algorithms will maintain the database, keep the libraries in sync with your model and allow easy changes when you need them.</p>
					<p>Your clients see only the facade of your systems - by offloading development effort onto the DSL platform you will be able to focus on what's really important to your clients: user experience and specialized business logic.</p>
