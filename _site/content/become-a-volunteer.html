  <p>
	WebCamp Zagreb is being organized as a community-driven event, with the help of sponsors and supporters, to make it available to as many people as possible. Still, there is some logistics and work to be done so that visitors would feel comfortable during the conference.
 </p>
  <p>
	  Because of that, we have introduced the volunteers program last year, and it’s been a blast! All of our last year’s volunteers immediately expressed their interest to participate this year as well, but as the conference has grown significantly, there is more space to fill-in to avoid volunteers becoming overloaded.
 </p>
  <p>
If you wish to participate in the on-site activities of this year’s WebCamp Zagreb conference, and the Week of WebCamp events, and to do some networking, this is your chance to give something to your community and meet new people from the industry you are, or will be a part of soon. 
 </p>
  <p>
Ideally, we encourage students, graduate students, and freshly employed IT professionals to join us and become active in the community, but we’re open to everyone else who wishes to help in making WebCamp Zagreb experience the best possible!
 </p>
  <p>
If you’re motivated to join us in organizing these events (which means you won’t be able to sit in the audience and listen to all the talks being presented at the conference), apply through the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1juvTg9eVNPH6WhnR9xntzRbxnojcRd4Wgqmclt0ITBA/viewform" target="_blank"> form</a>.
