  <h2>Announcing the speakers line-up</h2>
  <time>07.08.2014.</time>
  <p>CFP has ended on August 1st, and with 105 proposals submitted, we are very positively surprised by the outcome. As we sat down to do the selection, we knew it wouldn't be easy and that many great talks will fall below the line. Still, even greater talks will bubble up to the top and we’re sure we’ll be delivering an awesome event for all our visitors.</p>


  <p>First of all, thank you all for applying, you make things harder and harder for us every year. On the other hand, that is what makes us really happy, as WebCamp is growing rapidly in quality and acceptance by the community, and goes in line with our goal of creating the best developers conference experience in our region.</p>

<p>Before we publish our selected speakers list, we’d like to point out once more that we’re doing a <b>crowdfunding campaign</b> which will enable us to provide you a <b>full 2-day conference experience</b>. Here’s a glimpse of some topics you’d get if we pull it off:
<i>Abstracting the backend. NoBackend solutions and syncing data in real time.; Cassandra, web-scale NoSQL data platform; Correct, Beautiful, Fast product development; Developer Workflow in a Responsive World; Front-end h8#ff0000!!1;; Go mobile with Apache Cordova; JS, JS, are you mad? (AI talk); Responsive Web Components - A glimpse at the future; Taking Responsive a Step Further; Try the meal before you serve it - usability testing for your product; Wildest streams</i></p>

<p>Companies can participate in the campaign, as well as individuals, by picking up the packages for their employees and securing their ticket for the conference. <b>The campaign ends this Sunday, August 10th</b>, so if you’d like to see the above mentioned talks as well, act immediately - <a href="https://www.entrio.hr/en/event/webcamp-zagreb-2014-1579">buy a Supporter Pack</a>!</p>
