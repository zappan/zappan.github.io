  <h2>Announcing the speakers line-up</h2>
  <time>07.08.2014.</time>
  <p>CFP has ended on August 1st, and with 105 proposals submitted, we are very positively surprised by the outcome. As we sat down to do the selection, we knew it wouldn't be easy and that many great talks will fall below the line. Still, even greater talks will bubble up to the top and we’re sure we’ll be delivering an awesome event for all our visitors.
