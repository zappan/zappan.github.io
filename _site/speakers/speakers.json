And so it came to be - you either love it or hate it but JavaScript became the “all solving hammer”. It has come to the point that you can write anything in it - including your very own desktop and mobile application, using only web frontend technologies ruled by the almighty JavaScript.\nThe secret ingredient for this recipe is to “just add JavaScript”. In this talk some alternatives to native desktop and mobile development will be presented. There will be alternatives such as phonegap, node-webit and even something promising as NativeScript. But it won’t just sing praises to the mighty JavaScript king it will also cover the dark side of developing this type of software.",

It's becoming quite difficult to keep track of all the different components an application needs to function (a database, an AMQP, a web server, a document store...). It keeps getting harder and harder to setup new development environments and to bring new developers into the team. Stuff works on one dev machine but doesn't on others? Code breaks often when deployed to production even though all tests were passing and it worked on the dev machine?\n\nIn this talk I am going to show how to utilize light weight lxc containers using docker, and make your development process much more straightforward. How to share container images among your development team and be sure that everyone is running the exact same stack. Do all this without hogging too many resources, without the need for complex provisioning scripts and management systems. And above all else, how to do it fast!\n",

Stories are illustrative, easily memorable and often reach us on an emotional level.

Let us go through some examples and see how you can use storytelling to improve motivation, planning, hiring and changing perspectives. Whatever we tell ourselves, people often don't respond to reason, they respond to emotion. It doesn't matter if you're a project manager, a freelance designer or an engineer in an agile team - this applies to everyone.",
